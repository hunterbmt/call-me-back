# What is Call Me Back ? #

This is the Chrome extension to send voice or sms message to your friends.

Have you ever been in a situation when your mobile phone ran out of money, and you can no longer make a crucial call/SMS?

When that happens, use this extension to send a Voice/SMS message to your friends or family. Let them call back (assuming incoming calls are free)!



# Installation #

This extension is available in the Chrome Web Store. If you are looking to merely using the extension, get it [there](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jfkogeilgpfjgipncnbmkdmnapcampkp).

Otherwise, if you are a developer, you could fork this repository, make changes, and install the extension manually.



# Usage #

You need to register a Hoiio developer account first. Go to [http://developer.hoiio.com](http://developer.hoiio.com) and register one for free (even comes with free trial credits).

From Hoiio developer dashboard, create a new app, and find your App ID and Access Token.

Install the chrome extension, go to the extension settings, and enter your App ID and Access Token.
